## 2. Data Collection & Processing

### Historical Data
- Collect OHLCV data for selected cryptocurrencies across multiple timeframes (15m, 4h, 1d)
- Store in a structured format (HDF5 or Parquet) for efficient access
- Implement data cleaning routines for handling missing values and anomalies

### Feature Engineering
- Implement technical indicators:
  - Trend indicators: Moving averages, MACD, ADX
  - Momentum indicators: RSI, Stochastic, CCI
  - Volatility indicators: Bollinger Bands, ATR
  - Volume indicators: OBV, Volume MA
- Create cross-timeframe features:
  - Trend alignment across timeframes
  - Support/resistance identification from higher timeframes
  - Volatility regimes from higher timeframes
- Normalize all features using robust scalers

## 3. Synthetic Data Generation

### Pattern Generator
- Create a module that generates synthetic price data with predefined patterns:
  - Trend patterns: Bull/bear trends, breakouts, reversals
  - Chart patterns: Head & shoulders, double tops/bottoms, triangles
  - Support/resistance: Price reactions at key levels
  - Volatility regimes: Expansion/contraction cycles

```python
def generate_synthetic_pattern(pattern_type, params, noise_level=0.05):
    """
    Generate synthetic price data with specified pattern
    
    Parameters:
    - pattern_type: Type of pattern to generate ('trend', 'reversal', 'consolidation', etc.)
    - params: Dictionary of parameters for the specific pattern
    - noise_level: Amount of random noise to add for realism
    
    Returns:
    - DataFrame with OHLCV data containing the specified pattern
    """
    # Implementation would generate base pattern
    # Add realistic noise
    # Calculate appropriate volume profile
    # Return DataFrame with timestamps and OHLCV data
```

### Multi-Timeframe Synthetic Data
- Ensure consistency when generating synthetic data across timeframes
- Higher timeframes should be the aggregation of lower timeframes
- Implement proper timestamp alignment

### Synthetic Dataset Creation
- Generate a diverse dataset containing all key patterns
- Include varying market conditions (trend, ranging, high/low volatility)
- Create labeled data with expected optimal actions

## 4. Time Series Model Development

### Model Architecture
- Implement a multi-input architecture to handle different timeframes
- Use appropriate deep learning layers:
  - LSTM/GRU layers for sequence processing
  - Attention mechanisms for focusing on relevant patterns
  - Temporal convolutional networks for efficient processing

```python
def create_multi_timeframe_model(input_shapes, hyperparams):
    """
    Create a deep learning model that processes multiple timeframes
    
    Parameters:
    - input_shapes: Dictionary of input shapes for each timeframe
    - hyperparams: Model hyperparameters
    
    Returns:
    - Compiled model ready for training
    """
    # Create input layers for each timeframe
    # Process each timeframe with appropriate layers (LSTM/CNN)
    # Use attention mechanism to focus on important patterns
    # Merge timeframe-specific features
    # Output prediction layers
```

### Training Process
- Train on synthetic data first to learn basic patterns
- Fine-tune on historical data for market-specific learning
- Implement proper validation strategy with time-based splits
- Monitor for overfitting with appropriate metrics

### Evaluation
- Evaluate on out-of-sample data
- Implement comprehensive performance metrics:
  - Directional accuracy
  - Risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe, Sortino)
  - Maximum drawdown
  - Win/loss ratio

## 5. Reinforcement Learning Implementation

### Trading Environment
- Create a custom OpenAI Gym-compatible environment
- Implement realistic constraints:
  - Transaction costs
  - Slippage modeling
  - Position sizing rules
  - Risk management restrictions

```python
class CryptoTradingEnv(gym.Env):
    """
    Custom trading environment for cryptocurrency trading
    
    Supports:
    - Multiple timeframes
    - Long and short positions
    - Realistic transaction costs and slippage
    - Customizable reward functions
    """
    
    def __init__(self, data, reward_function, window_size=50, transaction_cost=0.001):
        # Initialize environment with data and parameters
        
    def reset(self):
        # Reset environment to initial state
        # Return observation
    
    def step(self, action):
        # Process action (buy/sell/hold)
        # Update state
        # Calculate reward
        # Return observation, reward, done, info
    
    def render(self):
        # Visualize current state and actions
```

### Reward Function Design
- Implement multiple reward functions:
  - PnL-based rewards
  - Risk-adjusted rewards
  - Consistent behavior rewards
- Allow for custom weighting of reward components

### Transition from Supervised to RL
- Use the pre-trained time series model as a feature extractor
- Implement a transition phase with imitation learning:
  - Train the RL agent to mimic optimal actions on synthetic data
  - Gradually shift to direct RL optimization

### RL Training Pipeline
- Start with DQN for simpler implementation
- Progress to more advanced algorithms:
  - PPO for better sample efficiency
  - SAC for improved exploration
- Implement proper hyperparameter tuning

```python
def train_rl_agent(env, model_type='dqn', pretrained_feature_extractor=None):
    """
    Train a reinforcement learning agent on the trading environment
    
    Parameters:
    - env: Trading environment
    - model_type: Type of RL algorithm to use
    - pretrained_feature_extractor: Optional pre-trained model for feature extraction
    
    Returns:
    - Trained RL agent
    """
    # Setup appropriate RL algorithm based on model_type
    # Configure replay buffer
    # Implement learning schedule
    # Train with proper monitoring and checkpointing

    - Manages order placement and tracking
    - Implements position sizing and risk rules
    - Handles error conditions gracefully
    """
    
    def __init__(self, exchange_config, risk_params):
